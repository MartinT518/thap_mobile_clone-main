3. On the "Settings" page, the user clicks on the new option "AI Assistant Settings".
TEXT ON SCREEN: Choose your preferred AI/LLM

3. A window for entering the API key will appear in the application.
4. After entering the key, the user presses the 'Confirm' button
5. The application validates the API key.
6. There will be a green text in the "Assistant ready" application.

SCENE 2: Use Case 1 - Pre-purchase product
VIDEO:
1. The user navigates back to the main view of "My Things" ("Product Wallet").
2. The user selects a product from the "Scan history" list that he does not yet own. For example "Reet Aus T-shirt".

Scenario 1: Pre-purchase information.
1. In the product view, the user presses the blue "Ask AI" button.
2. A new view will open. This is not an empty text field, but a list of contextual questions.
3. Questions to see (in English):
"What is the sustainability score for this product?"
"What are the similar alternatives?"
"How to properly care for this material?"
"Ask your question..." (below)
4. The user presses the prompt: "What is the sustainability score for this product?"
5. The application opens the chat window view in the application. The question and PRODUCT INFO (e.g. "Reet Aus T-shirt, EAN: XXXXX") are already pre-filled in the prompt window. The AI ​​will start generating the answer.

SCENE 3: Use Case 2 - Owned Product
1. The user returns to the THAP application, back to the "My Things" view.

Scenario 2: Manage your own product.
1. The user now selects a product that he already has (My things), for example "Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones".
2. The user presses the exact same blue "Ask AI" button.
3. The "Task Library" opens, but this time there is a completely different list of prompts.
4. You can see the questions (in English)::
"How to optimize this battery life?"
"Check warranty status."
"Find me authorized repair shops."
"What is the secondary market value at this moment?"
"Ask your question..." (below)
5. The user presses the prompt: "How to optimize the life of this battery?"
6. The process repeats. ChatGPT opens, the prompt is pre-populated, and the AI generates a response.
This AI view could be topped with the text THANK YOU!
