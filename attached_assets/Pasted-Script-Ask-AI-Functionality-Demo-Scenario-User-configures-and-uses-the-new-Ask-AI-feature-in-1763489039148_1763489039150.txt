3. On the "Settings" page, the user clicks the new option "AI Assistant Settings".
ON-SCREEN TEXT: Choose your preferred AI/LLM
VIDEO:
1. The "AI Settings" view opens. There is a list (e.g. "ChatGPT", "Gemini", etc.). The application shows the "Installed" mark next to them.
2. The user selects the AI ​​model, the right to use of which he has ordered from his official representative.
3. The application displays a window for entering the API key.
4. After entering the key, the user presses the 'Confirm' button
5. The application validates the API key.
6. The green text "Assistant ready" appears in the application.

SCENE 2: Use Case 1 - Pre-purchase product
VIDEO:
1. The user navigates back to the "My Things" ("Product Wallet") main view.
2. The user selects a product from the "Scan history" list that they do not yet own. For example, "Reet Aus T-shirt".

Scenario 1: Pre-purchase information.
1. In the product view, the user presses the blue "Ask AI" button.
2. A new view opens. This is not an empty text field, but a list of contextual questions.
3. The questions are displayed (in English):
"What is the sustainability score of this product?" 
"What are similar alternatives?" 
"How to properly care for this material?"
"Ask your question..." (at the very bottom)
4. User clicks on the prompt: "What is the sustainability score of this product?"
5. The app opens a chat window view in the app. The question and PRODUCT INFO (e.g. "Reet Aus T-shirt, EAN: XXXXX") are already pre-filled in the prompt window. The AI ​​starts generating the answer.

SCENE 3: Use Case 2 - Owned Product
1. User returns to the THAP app, back to the "My Things" view.

Scenario 2: Managing an Owned Product.
1. The user now selects a product that they already have (My things). For example, "Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones".
2. The user clicks on the exact same blue "Ask AI" button.
3. The "Task Library" opens, but this time there is a completely different list of prompts.
4. The questions (in English) are displayed:
"How to optimize the life of this battery?"
"Check warranty status."
"Find me authorized repair shops."
"What is the current aftermarket value?"
"Ask your question..." (at the very bottom)
5. The user clicks on the prompt: "How to optimize the life of this battery?"
6. The process repeats. ChatGPT opens, the prompt is pre-filled, and the AI ​​generates an answer.
This AI view could be topped with the text THANK YOU!
